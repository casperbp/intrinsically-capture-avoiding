\section{Conclusion and Future Directions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented a technique for capture avoiding substitution that does not require renaming of bound variables.
The technique results in substitution functions that perform capture avoiding substitution involving open terms, but which is as simple to implement and understand as substitution functions involving only closed terms.
This makes this style of substitution attractive for, e.g., teaching and learning the untyped $\lambda$ calculus.
By intrinsically typing substitution functions we have shown that our technique is indeed capture avoiding.

This paper only considers normalization to weak head normal form, using a \emph{call-by-value} normalization strategy.
We conjecture that the techniques are equally applicable to \emph{call-by-name normalization} strategies, as well as normalization to stronger normal forms.
We leave verification of this conjecture as future work.
