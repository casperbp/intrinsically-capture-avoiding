\section{Intrinsically Scoped Renamingless Capture Avoiding Substitution}
\label{sec:normalization}

We introduce an intrinsic scoping discipline for the untyped $\lambda$ calculus, inspired by \emph{intrinsic typing}~\cite{AltenkirchR99,Augustsson99anexercise}.
This intrinsic scoping discipline explains how our renamingless capture avoiding substitution strategy and the normalizers that use it rely on a loose notion of what it means for a term to be closed; namely, closed terms may contain free (but unsubstitutable) variables.

Our approach to intrinsic scoping is inspired by the Agda standard library\footnote{E.g., \url{https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/blob/v1.7.1/src/Relation/Unary.agda}} and the work of, e.g., Allais~et~al.~\cite{DBLP:journals/jfp/AllaisACMM21} and Rouvoet~et~al.~\cite{RouvoetPKV20}.

\subsection{Prelude to Intrinsic Typing}

We will associate untyped $\lambda$ terms with their set of free variables.
For example, $\lambda x .\, y$ where $x \neq y$ is encoded as a term associated with the free variable set is $\{ y \}$.
We will encode a syntax that intrinsically associates a term with its set of free variables by making it impossible to define terms with any other association.

To this end, we will encode terms as \emph{predicates over free variables}; i.e., the \ad{FVPred} type in \cref{fig:connectives} which uses a list of names to represent a (multi-)set of free variables.
\Cref{fig:connectives} also introduces the logical connectives we will use to write concise type signatures and normalizers, akin to the ones in the previous section, but which Agda can check are safe-by-construction.
We recommend that readers read \cref{sec:interpreting-closed-intrinsic} and consult \cref{fig:connectives} as needed.

% For example, in \cref{sec:interpreting-closed-intrinsic} we use the connectives to assert and verify that the closed substitution function from \cref{sec:interpreting-closed} only substitutes for closed terms, that substitution eliminates a free variable, and that normalization of closed terms only applies closed substitutions to compute closed $\lambda$ terms as a result.
% In \cref{sec:interpreting-open-intrinsic} we apply the same approach to the substitution function and normalizer from \cref{sec:interpreting-open}.

The logical connectives in \cref{fig:connectives} assume the existence of a union-like operation for lists of names
%
\begin{code}[hide]
record NameSetIntf (Name : Set) : Set₁ where
  field
\end{code}
\begin{code}[inline]
    _⊔_ : List Name → List Name → List Name

%
\ with accompanying laws proving that the operation is \emph{commutative} and \emph{monoidal} (i.e., \emph{associative} and the empty list is the \emph{identity element} w.r.t. \aF{⊔}).
It also assumes a difference-like operation

\subsection{Normalizing Closed $\lambda$ Terms using Intrinsic Typing}
\label{sec:interpreting-closed-intrinsic}

Using the operations in \cref{fig:connectives}, we define a data type of $\lambda$ terms that is intrinsically typed by the set of free variables of the term:
%
\begin{code}
  data FV : List Name → Set where
    lam  : (x : Name) → ∀[ (FV ─ x)  ⇒ FV ]
    var  : (x : Name) → ∀[ One x     ⇒ FV ]
    app  : ∀[ (FV ∧ FV)              ⇒ FV ]
\end{code}
%
The only inhabitants of the type \ad{FV}~\ab{xs} are terms whose set of free variables is exactly \ab{xs}.

Using the \ad{FV} type, we can refine the type of the substitution function from \cref{sec:interpreting-closed} to make explicit the assumptions about closedness that were previously implicit.
The type and implementation of the function is given below, where each \af{⋯} represents an elided (but straightforward) Agda proof term which uses the laws about the \aF{⊔} and \aF{∖} operations to prove to Agda that the intrinsic typing is valid.\footnote{The \af{\$} operation is an infix operation for function application (akin to the operation by the same name in Haskell).}

%
The type signature of the substitution function above says that the term being substituted for has no free variables (\af{ε[~FV~]}), and that the final set of free variables is the set of free variables of the term being substituted in minus the variable $x$ that was substituted (\af{∀[~FV~⇒~}\as{(}\af{FV}~─~\ab{x}\as{)}~\af{]}); i.e., no variables are captured.
%%The the substitution function inhabits this type, thereby showing that the substitution function is capture avoiding by construction.

The normalizer from \cref{sec:interpreting-closed} can be similarly generalized to show that normalizing a closed term is guaranteed to yield a normal form (value), where a normal form is a (closed) $\lambda$ value given by the \ad{NF} type:
\begin{code}
  data Val : Set where
    lam : (x : Name) → ε[ FV ─ x ] → Val
\end{code}
%
The type signature of the generalized normalizer is given below.
Its definition is case-by-case similar to the normalizer from \cref{sec:interpreting-closed}, and is elided for brevity.
%
\begin{code}
  {-# NON_TERMINATING #-}
  normalize : ε[ FV ] → Val
\end{code}
%
Unlike the normalizer from \cref{sec:interpreting-closed}, which was partial, \af{normalize} is a \emph{total}, possibly non-terminating function, because the type \af{ε[~FV~]} intrinsically guarantees that the input term has no free variables.
%

  normalize (lam x e) = lam x e

                                    of λ where
      (lam x e) →
        let v = Val2FV (normalize (e₂ ∶ FV ∣ proj₂ (⊔-id _ _ (sym φ))))
        in normalize ((⟦ v / x ⟧ e) ∶ FV ∣ (begin

          Val2FV (lam x e) = lam x e
\end{code}


\subsection{Normalizing Open $\lambda$ Terms using Intrinsic Typing}
\label{sec:interpreting-open-intrinsic}

We now show that our normalizer from \cref{sec:interpreting-open} provides similar guarantees as the normalizer for closed terms in \cref{sec:interpreting-closed-intrinsic}.
To this end we enrich the \ad{FV} type from before by an additional constructor for values given by a type parameter \ab{V}~\as{:}~\ad{Set}:\footnote{Here \af{const}~\as{:~\{}\ab{A~B}~\as{:}~\ad{Set}\as{\}~→}~\ab{A}~\as{→}~\ab{B}~\as{→}~\ab{A} is the \emph{constant function} which ignores its second argument, and always returns its first argument.}
%
\begin{code}
  data FVV (V : Set) : List Name → Set where
    lam  : (x : Name) → ∀[ (FVV V ─ x)  ⇒ FVV V ]
    var  : (x : Name) → ∀[ One x        ⇒ FVV V ]
    app  : ∀[ (FVV V ∧ FVV V)           ⇒ FVV V ]
    val  : ε[ const V                   ⇒ FVV V ]
\end{code}
%
Crucially, the \ac{val} case says that values have \emph{no free variables}.
However, below we will use a notion of value that may contain free variables.
But since these free variables are delimited by a value, they are \emph{unsubstitutable}.

Using this type of terms, we define a substitution function with a similar type signature as the substitution function from \cref{sec:interpreting-closed-intrinsic}.
It also has similar cases which we elide, except for the case for the \ac{val} constructor:\footnote{The \as{\_} in \af{FVV}~\as{\_} represents a term that we ask Agda to automatically infer for us.  In this case, Agda infers that it is the implicitly parameter type \ab{V}~\as{:}~\ad{Set}.}

%
As with the substitution function from \cref{sec:interpreting-closed}, we do not propagate substitutions into values.
Thus the only difference between the substitution function in \cref{sec:interpreting-closed-intrinsic} and the substitution function above is that the function above has a more liberal notion of what it means for a term to be closed; namely, it is either a plain closed term, or a value.

Using this substitution function we generalize the type of the normalizer from \cref{sec:interpreting-open} to operate on intrinsically typed terms.
Unlike the normalizer in \cref{sec:interpreting-closed-intrinsic}, the normalizer below takes \emph{open terms} as input and normalizes these to weak head normal forms:
\begin{code}
  data ValV : Set where
    lam : (x : Name) → ∀[ (FVV ValV ─ x)  ⇒ const ValV ]
    var : Name                            → ValV
    app : ValV → ValV                     → ValV
\end{code}
The normalizer is given by the \af{normalizeV} function:
\begin{AgdaAlign}
\begin{AgdaSuppressSpace}
\begin{code}
  {-# NON_TERMINATING #-}
  normalizeV : ∀[ FVV ValV ⇒ const ValV ]
  normalizeV (app (t₁ ∧ t₂ ∣ φ)) = case (normalizeV t₁) of λ where
    (lam x t)  → normalizeV $ (⦉ (normalizeV t₂) / x ⦊ t) ∶ FVV _ ∣ ⋯
\end{code}
\begin{code}[hide]
                                                            (∖-idemʳ _ _)
\end{code}
\begin{code}
    v₁         → app v₁ (normalizeV t₂)
  normalizeV (lam x t)  = lam x t
  normalizeV (val v)    = v
  normalizeV (var x φ)  = var x
\end{code}
\end{AgdaSuppressSpace}
\end{AgdaAlign}
The function is case-by-case similar to the function from \cref{sec:interpreting-open}.
However, thanks to its intrinsic typing information, we are guaranteed that (1) normalization only ever applies substitutions that are capture avoiding, since the substitution function only propagates closed terms past $\lambda$ bindings; and (2) normalization may yield values that correspond to open terms.
All without any fiddly renaming.
